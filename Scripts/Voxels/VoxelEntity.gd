#extends PhysicsEntity
# TODO: describes a set of voxels grouped together as one physics entity. Can be just one voxel or several. 
# You can use this class to make voxels explode or as a way to build vehicles/weapons in-game. 
# Example: can scale the mesh/colliders down to create a weapon from a design that a player makes in-game
# Example: can just generate a mesh/colliders/other stats to make a car/ship/whatever in-game
# Retains its voxel data so it can be "snapped" back into the world. 


# Declare member variables here. Examples:
# var a = 2
# var b = "text"


# Called when the node enters the scene tree for the first time.
func _ready():
	pass # Replace with function body.


# Called every frame. 'delta' is the elapsed time since the previous frame.
#func _process(delta):
#	pass
